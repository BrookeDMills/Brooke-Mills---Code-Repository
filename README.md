# R-Code
This is an explaination of the projects I have uploaded to this repository.

The D2A2 html and Rmd files are the files I created for the final project for my Environmental Data Science class. For this project I downloaded precleaned data on counties in Atlanta provided by my teacher into R-studio along with several packages to provide necessary functions. I then used these functions to further refine the data to focus on a few individual regions of Atlanta. I used this data to create clean and simple visuals that showed locations of regions relative to the entire Atlanta agea, differences in values between regions as well as trends in demographics in a specific area. I also wrote descriptions for each visuals that lead the reader through the information. This information was then compiled from the RMD to a presentable html file.

The ATL html and Rmd files are files created for one of the weekly assignments in my Environmental Data Science class. I downloaded data on several regions of Atlanta provided by my teacher and a couple packages. I used these to separate data on four specific regions and to create visuals showing differences for several values in these regions. This information was then compiled from the RMD to a presentable html file.

The Computional Essay html and RMD files are files I created to complete an assignment in my Environmental Data Science class. For this project I downloaded precleaned health data on states of the U.S.A provided by my teacher and well as several packages. I then used this data to divide the states into predetermined regions and created visuals this showed information on physical and mental health bewteen these regions in a couple different ways. I then used this information to draw a conclusion. This information was then compiled from the RMD to a presentable html file.

The 385-Final Essay document I uploaded contains a comprehensive review of the research and modeling I did for my Nature's Benefits to People class. For this class I uploaded a land cover map that of the Salt Lake Watershed in Utah that was provided by my teacher in QGIS. I then uploaded this same land cover map into a modeling program called InVEST, which I used to change the land cover to convey several potential future and past scenarios and to run said scenarios through the Annual Water Yield Model. The different land cover maps were also modeled in QGIS to provide a comparison. InVEST produced extensive data files which were then copied into excel and used to make tables comparing the different scenarios. I then used this data to draw conclusions within my essay.
